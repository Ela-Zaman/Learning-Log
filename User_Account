You’ll also implement a user authentication system. 
You’ll build a registration page for users to create accounts, and then restrict access to certain
pages to logged-in users only. 
Then you’ll modify some of the view functions so users can only see their own data. 
You’ll learn to keep your users’ data safe and secure.

Step:
User can add a new topic
User can add a new entry
User can edit their previous entry

Requirements:

In this section, we’ll set up a user registration and authorization system so
people can register an account, log in, and log out. We’ll create a new app
to contain all the functionality related to working with users. We’ll use the
default user authentication system included with Django to do as much
of the work as possible. We’ll also modify the Top sic model slightly so every
topic belongs to a certain user.
